# session-tracker README

Tracks how long folders have been opened. Should work with workspaces.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `sessiontracker.stopwatch.changebasedonfocus`: Determines if the extension will count any time that the current window is not focuses.

## Known Issues

 - Pausing one code window's tracking and then switching to another window that has the auto-start feature enabled, causes all windows to start tracking time.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Session Tracker.
